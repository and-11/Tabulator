                Guitar tablature, usually referred to as ‚Äútab‚Äù, is a method of notating music that empowers beginner
            guitarists to learn songs quickly and easily. Guitar tabs share similarities with music staff notation by
            showing you what notes to play, how long to play them, and what techniques to use. But when compared to
            standard music notation, learning and reading guitar tablature offers a serious advantage: it shows you
            where to play the notes on your guitar.
            </div>
            <div>
                This comes in handy, especially since the guitar has many different places to play the same notes. For
                this reason, understanding guitar tablature and learning how to read tabs for guitar is particularly useful
                for beginners and allows students to learn how to play the guitar without ever having to learn how to read
                traditional musical notation.
            </div>
                <div>
                Guitar tablature is the visual representation of the notes in a song. The standard guitar tab consists
                of six horizontal lines, with each line standing for the six strings on the guitar. When learning how to
                read tabs for guitar, you‚Äôll need to look at the tablature from top to bottom. The top line represents the
                high E string (the thinnest string) followed by lines that represent the B, G, D, A, and low E strings (the
                thickest string).
            </div>
            <div>
                This also reflects the view of the strings as you look down while holding your guitar. For this reason,   
                think of guitar tablature as your roadmap, for it will provide you with the fastest route to learning guitar
                songs.
            </div>
            <div>
                When reading guitar tablature, you will also see numbers on each line of tab. These numbers stand for
                the frets on your guitar, which are the metal strips found on the fretboard. The frets are numbered 0-24,
                start at the nut (the piece closest to the headstock), and run the entire length of the guitar neck.
            </div>    
            <div class="">
                For example, if the string has a 0, that means you play that string ‚Äúopen,‚Äù or without using your
                fretting hand. If the string has a 1, then that means you must play using the first fret. When learning how
                to read guitar tabs, it‚Äôs important to understand that 1 represents the first fret, 2 the second fret, 3 the
                third fret, and so on.

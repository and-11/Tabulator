                <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGuitar tablature, usually referred to as “tab”, is a method of notating music that empowers beginner guitarists to learn songs quickly and easily. Guitar tabs share similarities with music staff notation by showing you what notes to play, how long to play them, and what techniques to use. But when compared to standard music notation, learning and reading guitar tablature offers a serious advantage: it shows you where to play the notes on your guitar.
                <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis comes in handy, especially since the guitar has many different places to play the same notes. For this reason, understanding guitar tablature and learning how to read tabs for guitar is particularly useful for beginners and allows students to learn how to play the guitar without ever having to learn how to read traditional musical notation.
                <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGuitar tablature is the visual representation of the notes in a song. The standard guitar tab consists of six horizontal lines, with each line standing for the six strings on the guitar. When learning how to read tabs for guitar, you’ll need to look at the tablature from top to bottom. The top line represents the high E string (the thinnest string) followed by lines that represent the B, G, D, A, and low E strings (the thickest string).
                <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis also reflects the view of the strings as you look down while holding your guitar. For this reason, think of guitar tablature as your roadmap, for it will provide you with the fastest route to learning guitar songs.
                <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhen reading guitar tablature, you will also see numbers on each line of tab. These numbers stand for the frets on your guitar, which are the metal strips found on the fretboard. The frets are numbered 0-24, start at the nut (the piece closest to the headstock), and run the entire length of the guitar neck.
                <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor example, if the string has a 0, that means you play that string “open,” or without using your fretting hand. If the string has a 1, then that means you must play using the first fret. When learning how to read guitar tabs, it’s important to understand that 1 represents the first fret, 2 the second fret, 3 the third fret, and so on.
